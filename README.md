# MotionCube

I learn how to use the UIGestureRecognizer, to retrieve userâ€™s acctions on the screem as well as CoreMotion to get the orientation of the device in an application that allow me to play with small squares and small circles. This shapes have laws of physics like gravity, elasticity and collision using aUIDynamicAnimator.
